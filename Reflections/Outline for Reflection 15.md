# Outline for Reflection 15

## Intro: Parallel Processing

### Types of Parallelism

## Software Development for Parallel Processing

- Software has always been several decades behind in its utilization of available hardware.

### Steps

- Partitioning
- Coordination
- Communications overhead

## Speedup

- Amdahl's Law
- Utilization

## Flynn's Taxonomy

- GPU's (SIMD with many threads) can only solve very restricted problem domains. CPU's (4-8 cores) can handle much more open problem sets

## Multiprocessing

- Coarse, fine, and symmetric
  - The more advanced, the more moves from kernel (OS) to hardware

- Security vulnerability
- Cache-miss latency
- Shared memory
  - common high-level cache and locks
